## Reflection

For this repository, I used Tailwind and the [Fylo data storage component project](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-data-storage-component-1dZPRbV5n) from Frontend Mentor. Having made card-based components in previous assignments, I knew which utility classes I needed a little faster. I started by putting all the necessary text and images in containers, in preparation for multiple flexbox layouts. Utilizing extensive documentation, I then styled each part of the design. Finally, with the web version complete, I added various media breakpoints for responsiveness on smaller screens. My main challenge this time around was maintaining absolute positioning for both the web and mobile versions of the design, as well as designing graphics through CSS (such as the storage bar and the speech bubble). Even with tools to search my code for classes I've used for consistency, it's still hard to keep track as they accumulate. Outside of using this knowledge for, say, employers, I'll continue to prefer custom CSS in a separate stylesheet.
